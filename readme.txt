The coding task is completed including simple and intuitive user interface for adding companies, identifications and displaying pending identifications.

To have a better understanding the methods for json based requests and UI based requests are seperated. I have implemented helper classes for performing redundant tasks.

I have implemented one test case which tests the complete flow from adding companies, adding identifications and sorting identifications based on the sorting conditions.

Due to time constraint I am not able to perform form validations and also adding styles to user interface. However the values are validated for nullness at everystep. 

I hope, I've understood the problem statement correctly and implemented the same.
